# Singapore SCR Systems for Coal-fired Plants Market Analytical Segmentation Focuses On Companies, Production & Growth

<strong>According to a recently published analytical study titled ""Global SCR Systems for Coal-fired Plants Market Industry Analysis, Comprehensive Forecast, and Opportunities Assessment (2025–2033),"" the report provides an in-depth evaluation of market trends, growth opportunities, and projections.</strong>

The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system injects ammonia into the boiler flue gas and passes it through a catalyst bed where the ammonia and nitrogen oxide gas (NOx) react to form nitrogen and water vapor. In this process, the NOx reduction takes place as the flue gas passes through a catalyst chamber. Selective catalytic reduction is a post-combustion technology used in coal burning applications to reduce NOx emissions. SCR systems ultimately reduce flue gas NOx to N2 and H2O. This technology is the most efficient method of reducing NOx emissions in the coal fired power plants where in efficiencies of about 70 to 90 percent are required.
